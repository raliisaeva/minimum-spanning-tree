Minimum Spanning Tree Final Boss
1. What is my project and what does it do?

My project is about the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) concept and how to find an MST using either one of the two algorithms: Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm.
I made my project interactive, and it is shaped like a console. The user can enter commands (there is a navigation bar with a list of those). Using either the "Kruskal's algorithm" or "Prim's algorithm" command the user can enter their own data about a tree and with the help of my program they'll learn how to solve it step by step. I've also included general information about the algorithm (gotten from resources on the internet) and a section where I'm explaining the project, talking about "why this project", etc.

2. Why I made this project?
I've been coding for a long time and I've also been competing in national competitions and for them I had to learn about the minimum spanning trees. But, I also really liked the concept of them, and since I haven't come across many coding problems that are actually about MSTs, I wanted to create something that's solely about them and actually teaches someone how to use these two algorithms. This could also be helpful for competitors who are trying to learn them and remember how they actually work, so they can use them during competitions.

3. How did I make my project?
I made this project in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used what I already knew about the first two languages from school and Girls Who Code (I attended their Summer '25 Pathways program) and while I was doing the project, I learned the general things in JavaScript from W3Schools and YouTube Tutorials. I also used ChatGPT for debugging some blocks of my code, since I couldn't find the mistakes in my code and didn't know enough JavaScript to identify them.

4. What did I struggle with and what did I learn?
I definitely struggled with staying motivated while doing the project. Also, like I already mentioned, I didn't know nearly any JavaScript before starting my project and now I've written over 900 lines of code in JS and I've for sure learned a decent part from it which will help me for the future when I'm creating other projects in JS.

Here's how my project looks when you first run it:
